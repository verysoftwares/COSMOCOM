# Cosmo's Computer Adventure

A narrative-oriented mod project building on Apogee Software's 1992 DOS platformer, Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure. It's meant to be an "Episode 4" for the original game, where - years after his original adventures - Cosmo somehow gets sucked into a computer and has to escape this predicament.

## Design

Thematically, this mod explores the evolution of personal computing from the DOS era to 2025, with a branching plot told through silly characters and their questlines. Given that I'm starting with a full game and all its assets to leverage, there are quite a few new mechanics I can bring to the table. No spoilers yet, but you can expect a late November release.

## Implementation

Built with Borland Turbo C + Turbo Assembler straight from the 80s, the source code originates from the [Cosmore](https://github.com/smitelli/cosmore) reverse-engineering project by Scott Smitelli & contributors. This mod wouldn't be possible without it and its accompanying [Cosmodoc](https://cosmodoc.org) documentation resource.

MIT. Sorta. It's complicated.
